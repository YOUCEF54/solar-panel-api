Model Name: Gradient Boosting Classifier (ONNX)
Accuracy: 96.48% (from training)
F1-score: 0.9343
AUC: 0.9870

Format: ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)
File: best_model.onnx
Size: 55KB (reduced from 185KB joblib + 855B scaler)

Trained features (input order):
[temperature, humidity, light, R, G, B, RGB_mean, RGB_std, G_over_R, B_over_R]

Target variable:
cleaning_status  (0 = clean, 1 = dirty)

Dependencies:
- Python 3.8+
- onnxruntime >= 1.19
- numpy

Usage:
1. Compute derived features (RGB_mean, RGB_std, G_over_R, B_over_R) from R,G,B.
2. Create feature vector in the order above as float32 numpy array.
3. Load ONNX session and run inference with the feature vector.
4. Output[0] = prediction (0=clean, 1=dirty), Output[1] = probabilities
